# Game Design Plan (Lean)

## Pillars
1. Uneasy intimacy in a shared hotel space.
2. Rule instability between zones/rooms.
3. Social tension through shared economy.

## Current Playable Loop
- Spawn in hub
- Enter combat zones
- Defeat enemies
- Receive currency rewards
- Return to hub/lobby progression

## Next Mechanics
1. **Server-authoritative combat:** prevent forged kill/reward events.
2. **Zone rulesets:** per-zone modifiers (visibility, control inversion, permadeath variants).
3. **Enemy archetypes:** separate behavior modules (charger, ranged, ambusher).
4. **Meta-events:** room-level anomalies and narrative triggers.

## Scope Guardrails
- Prefer data-driven zone/enemy config before adding class depth.
- Keep first implementation deterministic and testable.
- Avoid feature creep until sync/security baselines are stable.

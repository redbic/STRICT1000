## Decision Points for Fullstack Lead

After reviewing these documents, you'll need to decide:

### 1. Scope Agreement
- Does Phase 1-5 feel achievable? Any concerns?
- Should we cut/postpone any features?
- Timeline realistic (10-12 weeks for core features)?

### 2. Starting Point
- **Option A:** Lobby redesign (visual impact, 1-2 weeks)
- **Option B:** One experimental room (gameplay innovation, 1-2 weeks)
- **Option C:** Both in parallel (if feeling ambitious)

**Recommendation:** Start with **Lobby + one room (The Gallery)**

### 3. Technical Feasibility Check
- **Projectile system** — doable with existing canvas setup?
- **Room rulesets** — complexity concerns?
- **Lobby evolution** — server-side state tracking concerns?
- **Audio/visual polish** — library recommendations?

## What These Documents Are

✅ **Game design vision**  
✅ **Strategic roadmap**  
✅ **Player experience goals**  
✅ **Feature descriptions with implementation hints**

---

## What These Documents Are NOT

❌ **Not production code** — these are blueprints, not implementations  
❌ **Not rigid requirements** — pushback/iteration expected  
❌ **Not technically exhaustive** — you'll discover edge cases in implementation  
❌ **Not final** — design evolves based on playtesting

---

## Core Philosophy

Every feature in these documents is designed to answer one question:

> **"How do we make Strict1000 a game players can't stop thinking about?"**

Not just functional. Not just fun. **Unforgettable.**

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review** these three documents
2. **Schedule a sync** to discuss scope, priorities, concerns
3. **Pick a starting point** (lobby or room prototype)
4. **Build, iterate, playtest**

Let's make something weird and wonderful.

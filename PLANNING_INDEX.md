## Decision Points for Fullstack Lead

After reviewing these documents, you'll need to decide:

### 1. Scope Agreement ✅ DECIDED
- ✅ Phase 1-5 confirmed achievable (9-12 weeks)
- ✅ Room 237 meta-narrative deferred to post-launch (high risk)
- ✅ Timeline realistic and validated

### 2. Starting Point ✅ DECIDED (2026-02-12)
- ✅ **Selected: Option C (Modified)** — Lobby redesign + The Gallery in parallel
- ✅ **Lobby redesign completed** — 1920s atmosphere with decorative elements
- ✅ **The Gallery completed** — Darkness ruleset validates "rule instability" concept
- ✅ **Result:** Both delivered in 1 day, validates approach

### 3. Technical Feasibility Check ✅ ASSESSED
- ✅ **Projectile system** — Feasible with existing canvas (3-4 days estimated)
- ✅ **Room rulesets** — Validated with The Gallery, architecture extensible
- ✅ **Lobby evolution** — Medium complexity, defer to Week 3-4
- ✅ **Audio/visual polish** — Low risk, integrate throughout development

**See [TECHNICAL_FEASIBILITY_ASSESSMENT.md](./TECHNICAL_FEASIBILITY_ASSESSMENT.md) for full analysis.**

## What These Documents Are

✅ **Game design vision**  
✅ **Strategic roadmap**  
✅ **Player experience goals**  
✅ **Feature descriptions with implementation hints**

---

## What These Documents Are NOT

❌ **Not production code** — these are blueprints, not implementations  
❌ **Not rigid requirements** — pushback/iteration expected  
❌ **Not technically exhaustive** — you'll discover edge cases in implementation  
❌ **Not final** — design evolves based on playtesting

---

## Core Philosophy

Every feature in these documents is designed to answer one question:

> **"How do we make Strict1000 a game players can't stop thinking about?"**

Not just functional. Not just fun. **Unforgettable.**

---

## Next Steps

**✅ COMPLETED (2026-02-12):**
1. ✅ **Reviewed** all planning documents
2. ✅ **Created** technical feasibility assessment
3. ✅ **Picked** starting point: Option C (Lobby + Gallery)
4. ✅ **Built** lobby redesign and Gallery room prototype
5. ✅ **Validated** approach with working prototype

**🔄 IN PROGRESS:**
- Projectile combat system implementation (Week 2)
- The Ballroom room design (Week 2)
- Receptionist dialogue system (Week 2)

**📋 UPCOMING:**
- More experimental rooms (Weeks 3-4)
- Currency shop (Week 3-4)
- Visual and audio polish (ongoing)

**📊 CURRENT STATUS:** Phase 1 (40% complete), Phase 2 (15% complete)

See **[IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)** for detailed progress report.

Let's continue making something weird and wonderful.

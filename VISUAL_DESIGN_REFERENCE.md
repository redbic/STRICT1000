# Visual Design Reference

## Art Direction
- Top-down, readable silhouettes.
- Hotel should feel elegant but hostile.
- Contrast gameplay-critical elements aggressively.

## Zone Palette Baseline
- **Hub:** warm neutrals, safe readability.
- **Training/combat:** colder tones, high enemy contrast.
- **Anomaly rooms:** constrained palette shifts + UI interference effects.

## UX Rules
1. Player, enemy, hazard, and portal must be distinguishable in under 200ms.
2. Damage and hit confirmation must be immediate and unambiguous.
3. HUD should never occlude core combat area.
4. Narrative visuals should not reduce control clarity.

## Immediate UI Priorities
- Add stronger host/party state indicators in lobby.
- Improve remote-player readability (nameplates vs clutter).
- Make zone transition feedback sharper (audio + short overlay pulse).
